This repository contains our version of a command-line interpreter known as a shell. It replicates the basic functionalities of the simple shell (sh) and was developed using the C programming language, leveraging system calls from the Kernel.

## About

This project was created as a requirement for Holberton School. A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for Unix-like operating systems. It serves as both an interactive command language and a scripting language, controlling the execution of the system through shell scripts. Learn more about Unix shells on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell).

## Features

This version of the super simple shell supports the following built-in commands:

- `exit`: Exit the shell with the `exit` command.
- `env`: Print the environment.
- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `ls -l`: List directory contents in long format.
- `ls -la`: List directory contents in long format, including hidden files.
- `cd`: Change the current directory.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.

## Installation

You can install this super simple shell using `git clone`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/henry-codex/simple_shell.git
